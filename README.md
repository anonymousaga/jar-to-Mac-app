# JAR To Mac .app Packager
An AppleScript app that converts JARs to Mac apps. Has the option to package in JRE 11 to make a dependency-less app or has the option to remove the JRE and include only a launching script and the provided JAR.

This was inspired by jExifToolGUI's Mac app, which has the option to bundle a JRE inside the app for optimal compatibility and to create a dependency-free app.
